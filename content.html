	  <h2> Basic Backup Guide, also known as the (B.B.G) </h2>
	  <p> Use cloud services like Dropbox and Google Drive for small things or group activities! <br> Keep in mind that both of these servies have paid versions that perform better, so keeping your files across multiple devices might also be a good idea. 
	  <p> Having physical storage like USBs and hard drives is also a great way to keep tons of data at once! <br> Some 2 terabyte hard drives go for around PHP 1,000, so they're pretty affordable if you need some space or if you want to back up your computer's current state. <br>  Make sure to check the drives for anything suspicious, though. </p>
	  <p> To back up a computer on Windows 11, head to your control panel, go into System and Security, then look for File History. attach a hard drive/usb, then hit the button and sit back while it backs up your computer! <br> It'll take a while if you have a ton of stuff on your computer, but it'll let you revert to the saved version of your computer at any time! </p>
